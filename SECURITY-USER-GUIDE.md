# File Security - User Guide

## What Changed?

DocSmith now protects you from accidentally opening dangerous files through the application.

## Security Tips

1. **Be suspicious of double extensions**: `report.pdf.exe` is NOT a PDF
2. **Don't open unexpected files**: Even if they appear to be from a customer
3. **Keep antivirus updated**: DocSmith blocks dangerous types, but scanning helps too
4. **Use regular Office formats**: Avoid .docm, .xlsm (macro-enabled) when possible
5. **Check file sources**: Only upload files from trusted sources

## Questions?

**Q: Can I customize which file types are allowed?**  
A: Yes, developers can edit `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` in `fileSecurityValidator.ts`

**Q: Will this affect file uploads?**  
A: No, you can still upload any file type. Security only applies when *opening* files.

**Q: What about ZIP files containing executables?**  
A: ZIP files are allowed (for legitimate documents), but EXE files inside won't open directly.

**Q: Can I disable this security?**  
A: Not recommended, but developers can set `useWhitelist: false` in the API endpoints.
